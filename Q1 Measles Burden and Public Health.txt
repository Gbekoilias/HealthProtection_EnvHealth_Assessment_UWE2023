Epidemiological Data analysis: Measles cases, deaths, and vaccination coverage in Nigeria
Nigeria experienced a persistent challenge in measles control from 2008 to 2018, with the Northern region facing higher incidence rates due to lower immunization coverage. Although the total confirmed cases varied, the incidence in 2018 (24.98 per 1,000,000) was lower than in 2008 (53.73 per 1,000,000). Despite vaccination campaigns, high numbers of unvaccinated children, particularly in the North, indicate the need for regional strategies. The 2017/2018 campaign, targeting over 40 million children, achieved 87.5% coverage. However, the effectiveness of campaigns is short-lived, with a resurgence of cases, emphasizing the need for sustained efforts.
With a population of 197 million, Nigeria's birth cohort is approximately 8 million children. Routine immunization covers only 42% at 9 months, leaving 64.3% susceptible. The Southern regions have higher MCV1 coverage, accentuating the regional disparity. The analysis reveals a high percentage of confirmed cases vaccinated, possibly due to vaccine failures, cold chain issues, or administration problems. The introduction of a second dose (MCV2) is crucial for improving population immunity. However, challenges like cold chain issues and vaccine administration need addressing to enhance overall effectiveness.
A total of 131,732 cases were recorded between January 2012 and September 2016. Most cases 57,892 (43.95%) were recorded in 2013 while the least 11,061 (8.4%) were recorded in 2012. A total of 817 deaths were recorded, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.62%. The highest CFR (1.43%) was recorded in 2012 while the least CFR (0.44%) was recorded in 2016. Only 8,916 (6.7%) cases were confirmed by laboratory tests. The trend of measles cases followed the same pattern throughout the years under review, with cases peaking at March, then gradually reducing to lowest level at June, which was maintained throughout the rest of the year. States in northern region of Nigeria recorded the highest attack rate (Yobe: 480.29 cases per 100,000 population, Sokoto: 284.63 cases per 100,000 population and Katsina: 246.07 cases per 100,000 population) compared to States in the southern region (Rivers: 11.72 cases per 100,000 population and Akwa Ibom: 13.59 cases per 100,000 population). Conversely, States in the southern region recorded the highest CFR (Ebonyi: 13.43% and Rivers: 3.27%).
measles infection remains a burden especially in the northern region of Nigeria. Although measles fatalities declined over the years, laboratory confirmation was sub-optimal. We recommended improvement on routine immunization and strengthening of regional laboratories diagnostic capacities, for successful eradication of measles from Nigeria.

Analysis of Measles in Nigeria: Cases, Deaths, and Vaccination Coverage
Measles Burden:
•	High: Nigeria has one of the highest burdens of measles in the world. In 2021, it had the world's largest number of cases with over 10,000 reported based on WHO data.
•	Significant: Measles is the fifth leading cause of under-five child mortality in the country.
Deaths:
•	Decreased: Compared to pre-vaccination era, deaths have significantly decreased. However, the number remains significant.
•	Varied: Case fatality rates (CFR) vary regionally, ranging from 1.9% to 12.4%.
Vaccination Coverage:
•	Low: National coverage is around 54%, below the WHO's 95% target for herd immunity.
•	Uneven: Coverage varies greatly across states, with the southern region having higher rates than the north.
Key Findings:
Despite progress, measles remains a major public health concern in Nigeria.
Low vaccination coverage, particularly in the north, contributes significantly to the high burden.
Addressing vaccine hesitancy and improving access to immunization are crucial for control.

Additional Points:
•	Outbreaks: Nigeria experiences frequent measles outbreaks, highlighting the need for stronger control measures.
•	Socioeconomic factors: Poverty, limited healthcare access, and cultural beliefs can hinder vaccination efforts.
•	Continued efforts: Sustained commitment from the government, healthcare workers, and communities is crucial to eliminate measles in Nigeria.
Recent data on measles in Nigeria indicates a concerning trend of increasing cases and deaths, despite vaccination efforts. A study by Weldegebriel (2011) found that suboptimal routine vaccination coverage and a wide interval between catch-up and follow-up campaigns contributed to a surge in measles cases. This was further highlighted by Ibrahim (2018, 2019), who reported a total of 131,732 cases and 817 deaths over a five-year period, with the northern region of Nigeria bearing the highest burden. The need for improved routine immunization and measles case management was emphasized. Geospatial analysis by Utazi (2020) revealed persistently low measles vaccine coverage in northern Nigeria, indicating the need for strengthened routine services. These findings underscore the urgency of addressing the challenges in vaccination coverage and case management to control the spread of measles in Nigeria.
Socioeconomic indicators affecting the affecting measles outcomes, such as income levels, education, and healthcare accessibility
Socioeconomic factors have a significant impact on measles burden, with lower socioeconomic status often associated with higher incidence and lower immunization coverage. In Germany, areas with lower deprivation had higher measles incidence, even after adjusting for demographic and spatiotemporal factors (Rohleder 2021). Similar findings were reported in Ecuador, where vaccination coverage was lower in poorer areas, particularly those with unsatisfied basic needs and higher proportions of indigenous and African-Ecuadorian residents (Rivadeneira 2018). This trend was also observed in the UK, with children from the most deprived communities consistently having the lowest measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine uptake (Hungerford 2015). In Kenya, wealth-related inequalities in measles immunization were largely influenced by household wealth, parent's education, and birth order (Malderen 2013). These studies highlight the need for targeted public health interventions to address the disparities in measles burden and immunization coverage.
Nigeria's Measles: A Tale of Inequality: Nigeria's high measles burden is deeply intertwined with socioeconomic disparities. Poverty breeds vulnerability: lower income families struggle to afford transport to clinics or prioritize vaccination amidst daily struggles. Education gap fuels hesitancy: misinformation thrives in areas with lower literacy, leading to vaccine refusal. Rural remoteness restricts access: distant communities face travel barriers and lack of healthcare facilities, hindering timely immunisation. These factors coalesce in geographical disparities, with northern states bearing the brunt: lower coverage, higher deaths. Bridging these gaps requires targeted interventions: addressing affordability, strengthening rural healthcare, and promoting community education. Only then can Nigeria achieve equitable health outcomes and finally silence the whispers of measles.

Socioeconomic indicators significantly impact measles outcomes in Nigeria. Onwujekwe (2007) and Onwujekwe (2005) both found that lower socioeconomic status is associated with greater difficulty in accessing and utilizing healthcare services, including for the treatment of endemic diseases. Antai (2009) further emphasized the role of individual and community-level determinants, such as ethnicity, occupation, household wealth, and hospital delivery, in influencing childhood immunization uptake. Edeme (2017) highlighted the positive impact of public health expenditure on health outcomes, including reducing infant mortality rates. These studies collectively underscore the need for targeted interventions to address the socioeconomic disparities that contribute to poor measles outcomes in Nigeria.

Socioeconomic Indicators and Measles Outcomes in Nigeria:
Several key socioeconomic indicators significantly impact measles outcomes in Nigeria:
1. Income Level:
•	Lower income: Directly affects ability to afford transportation, childcare, or missed work associated with vaccination. Prioritization of immediate needs can lead to immunization being neglected.
•	Wealthier families: More likely to access private healthcare and prioritize vaccination, contributing to uneven geographic disparities.
2. Education:
•	Low maternal education: Correlated with lower childhood vaccination rates. Limited knowledge about measles and vaccines fuels misconceptions and hesitancy.
•	Higher education: Increases awareness of the benefits of vaccination and empowers individuals to make informed decisions.
3. Healthcare Accessibility:
•	Rural areas: Often lack adequate healthcare facilities and trained personnel, leading to long travel distances and delays in accessing immunization services.
•	Urban areas: Generally have better access to facilities and personnel, although disparities may still exist between different socioeconomic groups.
4. Additional Factors:
•	Gender: In some regions, cultural practices may limit girls' access to healthcare, including vaccination.
•	Religion: Misinformation and mistrust within certain religious communities can contribute to vaccine hesitancy.
•	Social networks: Influence attitudes and behaviors. Strong community support for vaccination can overcome individual hesitancy.
Connections to Health Outcomes:
•	These factors combine to create pockets of low vaccination coverage, particularly in the northern region, where poverty, low education, and limited healthcare access coincide.
•	These areas then become susceptible to outbreaks, leading to higher rates of measles cases and deaths.
•	The inequitable distribution of risk and vulnerability highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions addressing these socioeconomic determinants of health.
Examples of Interventions:
•	Conditional cash transfers: Encourage immunization by providing financial incentives to low-income families.
•	Community mobilization: Address vaccine hesitancy through education campaigns and engagement with religious leaders.
•	Mobile clinics: Improve access to immunization services in remote areas.
•	Strengthening healthcare infrastructure: Invest in building and staffing facilities in underserved regions.
The age-related disparities in measles cases in Nigeria are significant, with children under five years being the most affected group (Aworabhi 2020, Bassey 2015, Aworabhi-Oki 2020, Fetuga 2007). This is due to a combination of factors, including poor data quality and surveillance, and a higher susceptibility to measles in urban areas (Aworabhi 2020, Bassey 2015, Aworabhi-Oki 2020). The implications of these disparities are severe, with a high burden of measles admissions and complications in young children, particularly those who are unvaccinated and of low socio-economic status (Fetuga 2007). These findings underscore the need for targeted immunization efforts and improved surveillance to address the age-related disparities in measles cases in Nigeria.
A review of measles cases in Bayelsa State, Nigeria from 2014-2018 found that the most affected age group was 1-4 years, with children under 5 years being more susceptible to the infection (Aworabhi, 2020). This is consistent with global trends, as measles primarily affects children (World Health Organization, 2020). The study also identified living in an urban area as a risk factor for measles infection (Aworabhi, 2020). This could be due to higher population density and lower vaccination coverage in urban areas (Orenstein et al., 2019). The findings underscore the importance of prioritizing immunization activities, particularly in urban centers, to reduce measles cases and protect vulnerable age groups.

Dear Parents and Guardians,
I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to address some concerns that have been raised regarding recent developments concerning measles. We understand that the health and safety of your children are of utmost importance, and we want to assure you that we are taking all necessary steps to address the situation.
Measles is indeed a contagious viral infection, and occasional outbreaks do occur globally, including in the United Kingdom. Despite our collective efforts to maintain high vaccination coverage, there are still challenges in preventing occasional outbreaks.
We have been made aware of a recent outbreak of measles in our community, and it is crucial to share accurate information to ensure everyone is well-informed. Measles is a notifiable disease, and we are working closely with health authorities to manage the situation effectively.
It's important to note the clinical features of measles, such as fever, a characteristic rash, conjunctivitis, cough, and coryza. While the symptoms can be severe, especially in unvaccinated individuals, it's equally important to remain calm. Factors such as age, vaccination status, and exposure risk play a role in the likelihood of infection.
In line with Public Health England (PHE) guidelines, we are implementing several preventive measures:
•	Vaccination: Ensure your child's vaccinations are up-to-date. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is highly effective and provides essential protection.
•	Hygiene Practices: Emphasize good hygiene habits with your children, including frequent handwashing, covering coughs and sneezes, and avoiding touching their faces.
•	Reporting: If your child exhibits any symptoms such as fever, rash, cough, or conjunctivitis, please report it promptly to healthcare authorities and keep them at home.
•	Community Cooperation: Cooperate with contact tracing efforts, and if your family has recently travelled to an area with known measles circulation, report it to the relevant authorities.
We understand that this may cause concern, but by taking these steps, we can collectively contribute to minimizing the impact of the outbreak and protecting our community.
If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact the school office or local health authorities. Your understanding and cooperation are vital as we navigate through this situation together.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Dear Parents and Guardians,
We are writing to address some concerns you may have heard about a potential measles case at our school. We understand that hearing about a contagious illness can be worrying, but we want to assure you that we are working closely with the Public Health England (PHE) to monitor the situation and take all necessary steps to keep everyone safe.
Current Situation:
As of today, two confirmed cases of measles have been identified among students at our school. Both individuals are currently receiving medical attention and are isolated at home. Public health officials are conducting contact tracing to identify and assess anyone who may have been exposed.
Important Facts:
Measles is a highly contagious disease, but it is also preventable. Most children in the UK are vaccinated against measles, and this vaccine is very effective in preventing serious illness.
The risk of transmission to other students and staff is low. Public health officials are taking swift action to identify and manage potential exposures.
We are following all PHE guidelines to prevent further spread of the virus. This includes enhanced cleaning and disinfection procedures, promoting good hand hygiene practices, and excluding unvaccinated individuals from school until the risk of transmission has passed.
What You Can Do:
•	Stay calm and informed. We will continue to update you with the latest information through our school website and emails.
•	Monitor your child for symptoms of measles: These include fever, cough, runny nose, and a red, blotchy rash that starts on the face and head and spreads to the rest of the body.
•	If your child develops any of these symptoms, keep them home from school and contact your doctor immediately.
•	Make sure your child is fully vaccinated against measles. The MMR vaccine is safe and effective, and it is the best way to protect your child from this serious illness. If you are unsure about your child's vaccination status, please contact your GP.
•	Together, we can prevent the spread of measles and keep our school community healthy. Please do not hesitate to contact the school or Public Health England if you have any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
The School Leadership Team
